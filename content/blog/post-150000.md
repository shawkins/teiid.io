See all 44 issues in [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/TEIID/versions/12345713) and see the [Release Notes](http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/15.0.x/content/reference/Release_Notes.html).  

Special thanks go out to our GSOC intern [Aditya Manglam Sharma](https://github.com/aditya300899) for his work toward HDFS and S3 support.  His efforts have helped this release have more new functionality compared to the last couple of major/minor releases.  Aditya is also closing in on a parquet translator for Teiid 16.

There were also contributions from [Mudit Jian](https://github.com/ciphereck), as well as issues identified by Dmitrii Pogorelov, Ken Geis, Renat Eskenin, Manoj Majumdar, Nayan Bija, Rafael Sampaio, and Rui Wang.

As with Teiid 14 there isn't much in this migration.  It keeps the same JRE and WildFly requirements as Teiid 14.  You can still consult the [Migration Guide](http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/15.0.x/content/admin/Migration_Guide_From_Teiid_14.x.html) when upgrading.  

Also the master and 15.x documentation are back in good shape - old links will even still work.

Teiid 13.1.2 will be released shortly.

Thank you, 
The Teiid Team
