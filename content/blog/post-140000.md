The feature highlights for 14.0 are:

- [TEIID-5859](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5859) Upgraded to WildFly 19.1.0 including bringing the default standalone-teiid configuration up to date.
- [TEIID-5927](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5927) [TEIID-5935](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5935) The amazon-s3 translator is now capable of utilizing other s3 services including minio and ceph.

[teiid.io](http://teiid.io) has also undergone a lot of polishing during this release cycle to better reflect the state of the Teiid related projects.  Please have a look around and see where we can still make improvements. 

See all 37 issues in [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/TEIID/versions/12344586) and see the [Release Notes](http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/14.0.x/content/reference/Release_Notes.html).  Special thanks go out to Dmitrii Pogorelov for reporting a lot of pressing issues, and thanks to Luca Castelluzzo, Manoj Majumdar, and Rui Wang for reporting several other issues.

If you are on 13.x or older, please review the [Migration Guide](http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/14.0.x/content/admin/Migration_Guide_From_Teiid_13.x.html) when upgrading.

Teiid 14.0.1 will be released in approximately 8 weeks.  We are switching to mostly major release numbers, so next will be Teiid 15 in approximately 8-12 weeks.

Thank you, 
The Teiid Team
