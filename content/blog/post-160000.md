##### Teiid 16.0.0 is now available for [download](/teiid_wildfly/downloads/) and includes 44 total issues addressed.

<!--more-->

The feature highlights for 16.0 are:

* [TEIID-6021](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-6021) Added bulk update and delete handling for Salesforce.  Bulk update can be controlled via a hint or now by execution properties.  Bulk delete behavior can also be specified as hard delete via a hint or execution property.
* [TEIID-4594](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-4594) Thanks to Aditya Manglam Sharma we've added a parquet translator for use with file sources - namely file, hdfs, and s3.
* [TEIID-5861](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5861) Added multiple join support to the salesforce translator which can be enabled with the maxFromGroups translator property.

See all 33 issues in [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/TEIID/versions/12346820) and see the [Release Notes](http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/16.0.x/content/reference/Release_Notes.html).  Of note is that there were quite a few salesforce translator bugs addressed.  

A delayed thanks go out to our GSOC intern [Aditya Manglam Sharma](https://github.com/aditya300899) for his work toward parquet support.

There were also issues identified by Alf Lerv√•g, Fabian Knoll, Dmitrii Pogorelov, and Renat Eskenin.

As with Teiid 14/15 there isn't much in this migration.  It keeps the same JRE and WildFly requirements as Teiid 14/15.  You can still consult the [Migration Guide](http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/16.0.x/content/admin/Migration_Guide_From_Teiid_15.x.html) when upgrading.  

Keep in mind that for subsequent major releases we will be looking for broader community involvement in completing feature work.

Thank you, 
The Teiid Team
