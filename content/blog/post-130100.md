##### Teiid 13.1.0 is now available for [download](/teiid_wildfly/downloads/) and includes 37 total issues addressed.

<!--more-->

The feature highlights for 13.1 are:

- [TEIID-5874](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5874) added support for transactional Infinispan/JDG access.  Support for cache aliasing was removed.
- [TEIID-5896](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5896) added support for EXTRACT QUARTER and EPOCH.
- [TEIID-5798](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5798) added the POLICY construct to replace specifying a CONDITION on a permission.

See all 37 issues in [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/TEIID/versions/12343180) and see the [Release Notes](http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/13.1.x/content/reference/Release_Notes.html).  Special thanks go out to Cristoph John, Ken Geis, Renat Eskenin, Scott Seaton for reporting several important issues.

If you are on 12.x or older, please review the [Migration Guide](http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/13.0.x/content/admin/Migration_Guide_From_Teiid_13.x.html) when upgrading.

Teiid 13.0.3 will be released in approximately 6 weeks.  Beyond that we will likely move on to a Teiid 14 rather than releasing a Teiid 13.2.

Also know that the documentation for 13.1+ has been getting a bit of an overhaul to align the community asciidoc source with productization efforts.  If you find anything amiss - such as a broken link - it is likely due to some of this work.  We'll backport fixes as to keep the teiid.github published docs in working order. 

Thank you, 
The Teiid Team
