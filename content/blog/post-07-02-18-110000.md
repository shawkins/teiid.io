##### Teiid 11.0.0 is now available for [download](/teiid_wildfly/downloads/) and includes 51 total issues addressed including new Exasol connectivity.

<!--more-->

This was a somewhat shorter release cycle than several of the recent minor releases, but addressed a similar number of issues.  Since we are doing more frequent releases we will try to keep even major release increments managable.

Please see the [Migration Guide] (http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/11.0.x/content/admin/Migration_Guide_From_Teiid_10.x.html) and [release notes] (http://docs.jboss.org/teiid/11.0.0/teiid-releasenotes.html) when upgrading.  In particular the default salesforce connectivity has been bumped to version 34, Teiid in embeeded scenarios will default to a smaller amount of disk usage, and function model support has been completely removed.

The feature highlights for 11.0 are:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-4520">TEIID-4520</a> Added the Exasol translator.</li>
  <li><a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5356">TEIID-5356</a> Improved column metadata with DDL views - and other metadata fixes such as TEIID-5361 and TEIID-5359</li>
  <li><a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-3439">TEIID-3439</a> Added support for table aliases to contain a period '.' character</li>
  <li>Various SQL compatibility issues to support <a link="https://www.jooq.org">JOQL</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIIDTOOLS-437">TEIIDTOOLS-437</a> OpenTracing integration for remote JDBC clients.  Further automatic integration will be provided via Thorntail.</li>
</ul>

See all 51 issues in [JIRA] (https://issues.redhat.com/projects/TEIID/versions/12335494).  Special thanks go out to dalax dalax, Bram Gadeyne, Lukáš Svačina, and Harold Campbell for reporting several important issues.  Harold's contributions addressed many issues with the JPA translator - if you use the that translator consider upgrading to 10.3 or 11.0 latest.

You can expect a fix release in 4-5 weeks. Thank you, The Teiid Team
